# grunt-literate

> Generate docs from your source

## Getting Started

This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.1`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before,
be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide,
as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins.

Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```sh
npm install grunt-literate --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-literate');
```

## The "literate" task

In your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `literate` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  literate: {
     "README.md": "lib/foobar.js"
  }
});
```

The source will be parsed as JavaScript, and `/** ... ` comments extracted to the destionation file.
This example uses markdown, but you are free to use any format, or even just plain text.
